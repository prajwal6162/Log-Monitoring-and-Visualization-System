This project demonstrates end-to-end monitoring of:

A website (uptime, SSL, latency)

The server hosting the website (CPU, RAM, Disk, etc.)

using Prometheus, Node Exporter, Blackbox Exporter, and Grafana.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Components
1. Prometheus

A time-series database for metrics.

Collects metrics from exporters via /metrics endpoints.

Stores data in TSDB (Time Series Database).

Query language: PromQL.

Default port: 9090

2. Exporters

Exporters collect metrics from different systems and expose them for Prometheus.

Node Exporter

Scrapes metrics from the server (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network).

Runs on port 9100.

Blackbox Exporter

Scrapes metrics from websites/endpoints (SSL expiry, uptime, response time, DNS, TCP, ICMP).

Runs on port 9115.

3. Grafana

Visualization and dashboarding tool.

Connects to Prometheus as a data source.

Provides customizable dashboards for metrics.

Default port: 3000

üîë Required Open Ports
